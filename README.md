MAIN SCENARIO
In this project, it is requested to develop a transportation database model in which different
transportation alternatives for a country (sea, air, road, mobile transportation, metro, etc.) are
recorded at macro and micro levels. In this system, transportation will be provided with a unique card
for each citizen. Citizens' transportation histories, searches and preferences will be recorded. Macro
and micro level queries can be made in the system.
The project is more than a technical implementation project, which means you should focus much
more on the analysis and design of the database. How you combine each design is critical for the
evaluation and the originality of your design is crucial.

ANALYSIS
Examine the websites below and write the data requirements for
each website that fit the main scenario above.

DESIGN-CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
Create separate EER diagrams for each website according to your data
requirements.
Combine all E2/R diagrams. Explain your method before starting the assembly process.


DESIGN-LOGICAL MODEL
Convert EER diagram into a relational model using the methodology that will be
introduced in your course.


IMPLEMENTATION-PHYSICAL MODEL
1.  Write down the appropriate SQL scripts (DDL statements) for creating the database
and its relational model. You can select any of the DBMS you wish.
2.  Populate the database you just created again using SQL script file loaded with sample
tuples. The initial database should have the tuples of our department. (The tables should
have enough tuples for the SELECT statements to be run accordingly.)
3.  Write down 3 triggers for 3 different tables. Triggers should be meaningful.
4.  Write down 3 meaningful check constraints.
5. Write down the following SQL statements:
a.  Write sample INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE statements for 3 of the tables you
have chosen.
b. Write 5 SELECT statements for the database you have implemented.
i.  2 of them should use a minimum of 2 tables.
ii. 3 of them should use a minimum of 3 tables.
c.  Write 4 original SELECT statements that you think are critical.
